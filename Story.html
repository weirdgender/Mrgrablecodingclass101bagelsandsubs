  <p><i>Welcome to 101 Bagels and Subs — Oceanside’s Favorite Neighborhood Deli
Located just minutes from the beach, 101 Bagels and Subs has been serving the Oceanside, California community with freshly made bagels, hearty subs, and locally roasted coffee since 2005. What started as a small family-run shop with a passion for New York–style bagels and California-inspired flavors has grown into a beloved breakfast and lunch spot for locals, surfers, and travelers alike. Every bagel is boiled and baked fresh each morning, and our subs are crafted to order with premium meats, crisp veggies, and house-made spreads. Whether you’re stopping by after a morning surf or grabbing lunch on your break, 101 Bagels and Subs is where Oceanside comes together for good food and good vibes.

Our Story and Commitment to the Community
Founded by the Ramirez family, 101 Bagels and Subs began as a dream to bring authentic East Coast bagel traditions to the laid-back coastal culture of Southern California. Over the years, our little deli on Highway 101 has become a community staple — a place where friends meet, families gather, and visitors discover their new favorite sandwich. We’re proud to source ingredients from local California farms and bakeries whenever possible, supporting our neighbors and keeping everything fresh and sustainable. From classic breakfast bagels to signature subs like “The Oceanside Special,” every bite reflects our love for quality, community, and coastal living. <br> <br>
<br>
We have always been familiar with our locals and love meeting new customers to share our joy for food and comfort. We like to keep our shop calm and quiet for others who may need peace and quiet to rest and recharge their batteries. Unlike most restaurants, we like to keep it a casual environment for kids, groups of people, and of course our furry dog friends. We provide indoor and outdoor seating catering to your preferences. We hope to meet new customers and can’t wait for your arrival to try out our food and enjoy our safespace.</i></p>

  <h3><i><u>Our Local Customers Reviews:</u></i></h3>
						
						<ul>			
  <li><p><i>Everything you want from a local bagel shop. Family vibes, personal and comfortable service, and an absolute DELICIOUS bagel sandwich? yes to all. If you're in Oceanside and are posed with the question: "Where should we go for food?" Check to see if 101 is open and head that way
</i></p></li>
						
<li><p><i>101 Bagels is the best local spot to get a bagel and coffee! The Turkey, bacon, and avo is a great choice! I like to mix it up with a jalapeño bagel or a combo (everything) bagel. The owner is super cool and staff are friendly. The bagels are always fresh and the coffee warm!</i></p> </li>
			
						
<li><p><i>If you are from New England/New York you will definitely love this spot. Prices are not the same as easy coast obviously but the atmosphere, and staff definitely make you feel at home. They have gluten free options but they do not prepare celiac friendly unless you ask. Cheese and egg on a plain bagel was $6 and their fancier bagel sandwiches are closer to $13. Really enjoyed the owners and the location is a bit tough to park if its busy but it's worth the walk. I'll be coming back to try their other stuff</i></p></li>
						
						
<li><p><i>10000/10 I want to come back here for breakfast and lunch every day I ordered the vegetarian - it's egg, cheese, onion, tomato, sprouts and avocado on your choice of bagel. I got Asiago cheese. SO GOOD. The service was quick and super friendly. I got half to go and they wrapped it up for me and put it in a bag. That's service! The inside isn't anything special, I like sitting outside but it's a small local place. If you want a bomb bagel come here!!</i></p></li>
